## Project division

This project is divided into three parts:

1. [Monitoring (tracking) metrics using CloudWatch](./source/monitoring-ec2-metrics.md)
2. [Setting and monitoring log files over CloudWatch](./source/monitoring-ec2-logs.md)
3. [Setting Alarms in the CloudWatch console](./source/setting-alarms.md)

## Technical requirements

This demonstration was set up on Amazon Web Services console. However, in order to access the VM, native CLI and openssh were used on Ubuntu 18.04.
