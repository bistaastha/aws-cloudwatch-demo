# Part one: Monitoring EC2 metrics

EC2 stands for Elastic Cloud Compute, and it is the AWS service used for provisioning virtual compute resources.

EC2 can be used for availing compute resources like vCPUs, vRAMs and additional storage can be attached with these instances. EC2 instances come pre-installed with the server OS of different kinds. A Cloud Consumer can provision these resources over cloud and then access the instance remotely from either:

1. A web-based CLI tool
2. A native CLI tool using SSH key pairs
